-- TinyFCK - TinyMCE with FCKEditor file manager --
---------------------------------------------------

There are two big open source rich text editors:
 * FCKEditor
 * TinyMCE

Some people prefer the first, some other the second, 
but thereâ€™s a problem for who likes to use TinyMCE: 
it lacks of a free file manager/uploader.

What we actually need is to have a TinyMCE installation with a free 
file manager/uploader, thus we take it from FCKEditor.

This is TinyFCK: a TinyMCE with the FCKEditor's file manager/uploader, 
nothing less, nothing more.

-- Details --
-------------

TinyFCK package contains:
 * a TinyMCE release (absolutely not patched, this is the original TinyMCE)
 * a patched version of FCKEditor file manager/uploader
 * an example documenting configuration
 
Upload connectors are disabled by default for security reasons, look at the
code of every connector to enable it. Connectors are in 
filemanager/connectors directory.

-------------

Copyrights are holded by the authors of FCKEditor (http://www.fckeditor.net) 
and TinyMCE (http://tinymce.moxiecode.com), at the same way of support, 
what we've done is only integrate the two projects.

The idea of TinyFCK and the integration is developed by CreaLabs (http://www.crealabs.it).
